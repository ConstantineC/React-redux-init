# React-redux-init
Initial template for development React-redux apps

This is the very first my template for development React-redux applications. 
It consist React-redux architecture, some sample to understand how app works, 
Webpack configuration (including SASS, Bootstrap, ES6 via Babel).

To start working you need to download the repository and type "npm install" in command line.

Commands for development and production builds: 

development - "npm run dev"
production - "npm run prod"


Future plans: 

1) Find out how to work with purify-css webpack plugin without issues.
2) Add Express.js and MongoDB support for full-stack development.
